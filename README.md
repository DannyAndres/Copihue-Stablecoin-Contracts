The [Copihue Stablecoin](https://copihue.financial) mechanism is based on the [Jacob Eliosoff](https://twitter.com/JaEsf) research about "What's the simplest possible decentralized stablecoin?" ([part 1](https://ethresear.ch/t/whats-the-simplest-possible-decentralized-stablecoin/7676) [part 2](https://ethresear.ch/t/update-on-the-usm-minimalist-stablecoin-two-new-features/7851)), there's also two Medium entries explaining the proposed model in a more friendly and comprehensive way, written also by Jacob ([part 1](https://medium.com/@jacob.eliosoff/whats-the-simplest-possible-decentralized-stablecoin-4a25262cf5e8), [part 2](https://medium.com/@jacob.eliosoff/usm-minimalist-stablecoin-part-2-protecting-against-price-exploits-a16f55408216)).

I had to mention that the majority of the code (at this initial stage at least), was taken from the public repository associated to the previous mentioned investigation by Jacob (why reinvent the wheel, right?), which can be found here [USM Stablecoin](https://github.com/jacob-eliosoff/usm-stablecoin), also i want to mention [Alberto Cuesta Ca√±ada](https://twitter.com/acuestacanada) for he's amazing work updating the repository to a more recent version, and for implementing the [eip-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) on it.

If you have any further comments about the project, please feel free to drop me a message on Twitter, [Carlos Baeza N.](https://twitter.com/cjbaezilla).
